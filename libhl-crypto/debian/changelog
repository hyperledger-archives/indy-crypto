libindy-crypto (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Indy Crypto ]
  * BLS: verification optimization
  * Rust API enhancements (add more Clone derives for structures)
  * CL: update link-secrets logic - allow to use multiply link-secrets as non-schema attributes
  Note:
  This version of Indy Crypto can process artifacts from previous one.
  But in reason of multiply link-secrets support older versions can't consume CL output of 0.4.2.
